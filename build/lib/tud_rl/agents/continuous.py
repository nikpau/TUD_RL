"""
Agent dispatcher module. 

This file walks through all `*.py` files in the `_continuous`
folder and sets their classes as attributes of 
the present module.

This allows for a plug-in like system. 

To add a custom agent, create a new file and place
your agent class into it. In order to be recognized by
the plug-in system, your agent class must have the 
same name as your file + "Agent". 

Any class that does not follow this pattern won't be 
an available Agent during training.

Example: 
    New file: `CustomDDPG.py`
    Class to be exported: `CustomDDPGAgent`
    This is equiv. to `from CustomDDPG import CustomDDPGAgent`
